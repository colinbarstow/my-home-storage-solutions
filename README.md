<h2 style="color:red">Project is currently in development</h2>

A 3D storage configurator that can be used to design fully customizable Storage units. Built using Three.js this project allows customers the freedom to build their perfect storage configurator as if they were a fully fledged 3d modeler. 
The Storage configurator sits on top of a fully bespoke eCommerce system built in Laravel that allows for the sale of traditional products and the custom designs created by the customer.
